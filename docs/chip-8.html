# chip-8 assembler in zig  

This is an assemler/de_assembler for chip-8 and schip-8 written in Zig (version 0.14.0).  

You can write comments with the following syntax:  
```
#This is a comment
```
or after an opcode:  
```
exe 0xE0 # This is the same as cls  
```

The language supports labels with the following syntax:  
[label_name]: This is for declaring a label, this can be on it's own line or before an opcode  
:[label_name] This is how to specify which label to jump to.  
Labels can be used as an arguemnt for any opcode that asks for an address(Including the chip-8 variant of the "rjp" opcode)  
Example:  
```
clear: clr  
# An example of a "function"  
# The only restriction on a label is that it can only consist of letters
# It can have the same name as an opcode  
ext:  
  ext  
  ret  
jmp :clear  
cal :ext  
```

The language supports decimal, hexadecimal (0xN), octal (0oN) and binary (0bN) format for numbers.  
The assembler defaults to hexadecimal unless otherwise specified.  

This is a list of all the commands that are supported, their assembly like equivalent, what they assemble to and their description  
Each opcode and number is 4 bits and represented in hexadecimal (In the following "table")  
N: A 4 bit number (NN for 8 bit and NNN for 12 bit addresses)  
rx, ry: A register (x and y values are 0-15)
